# Sheet Maker

This is both a toolkit for building character sheets for tabletop RPGs and a demo of how to use it. The demo
can be found at https://mortenchristiansen.github.io/sheet-maker/#/ and is an example of how to use the
toolkit to create an Ars Magica 5e character sheet. If you try it out, start by pressing the "Create New Character" button at the buttom of the page. You can also install the web app as a PWA. The code is only tested on Chrome and Windows.
